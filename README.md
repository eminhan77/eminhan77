- 👋 Hi, I’m @eminhan77 ==>Emin Han ÇELİK
- 👀 I’m interested in technological issues, about the software development area, I want to be a good programmer and my aim is to focus on the problems that will improve my side of knowing the information about the software. Also, I like searching on different topics to increase my knowledge about any issue and trying to develop my remark over the problems. I like reading books, watching movies/sport channels.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a well informed student who has the skill to solve the problems.
